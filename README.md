OO - Orientação a Objetos (Oriented Object programming)

Discipline taken in the second semester of 2017<br>
Here are the projects using objects and classes, written in c++ and ruby.<br>
One of them is my first website made with ruby on rails (projetcs/ep3). 
These projects where first saved at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/marcelo_604/projects).
